## 2. Template Description

This project is a quick app store template.

## 3. How to use

### 3.1 Debugging Quick Application Development Tools (Recommended)

You are advised to download the Quick Application Development Tool (https://www.quickapp.cn/docCenter/IDEPublicity) to perform code scanning debugging, USB debugging, web preview, and syntax prompting. For details, see (https://doc.quickapp.cn/tutorial/ide/overview.html).

### 3.2 Command Line Debugging
```bash
cd book-template && yarn
yarn start #Recommendation

# Or run the following command:
yarn server & yarn watch

# Or run the following command on the tab page of terminal 1:
yarn server
# Run the following command on another tab of the terminal:
yarn watch

#The Quick App page is added.
yarn gen YourPageName
```

Use an Android mobile phone to download and install the [Quick App Debugger] (https://www.quickapp.cn/docCenter/post/69). Open the app and scan the QR code generated by the preceding command to view the effect. For more information, see [Quick Application Environment Setup] (https://nice.lovejade.cn/zh/article/develop-quick-app-experience-notes.html# Environment Setup).


## 4. Tips:

- **more elegant processing of data requests**; The `Promise` is used to encapsulate the system built-in request `@system.fetch` and throw the request to the global system. In this way, chain invocation can be simplified and `finally` can be used.

- **built-in style processing scheme**; Quick Apps support `less` and `sass` precompilation. The `less` scheme is adopted, and some variables are built-in, and common mixed methods are used to enable style editing, reuse, and modification.

- **Common encapsulation methods**; In the `helper/utils` path, common methods such as date, character string, and system are encapsulated separately and exposed to `global.$utils`. This makes the maintenance mode more reasonable and robust, facilitates use, and improves development efficiency. Of course, you can add, delete, or expand as needed.

- **Simplify the process of starting development**; Inject the [Concurrently](https://github.com/kimmobrunfeldt/concurrently) plug-in so that you can run `yarn start` to start development without requiring more commands, simplifying the development process.

- **Add the command script for adding a page**; To create a page, run the `yarn gen YourPageName` command. You can also customize the template */command/gen/template.ux* as required.

- **Integrates [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) & [Eslint](https://eslint.org/)** . Unify team code specifications and styles (such as `js`, `less`, and `scs`) while detecting potential problems in code to promote high-quality code writing and improve work efficiency (especially for team development).

- **New file listening command**: The [onchange](https://github.com/Qard/onchange) dependency is introduced to monitor file changes. During development, you can run the `yarn prettier-watch` command to format the modified `*.ux` and `*.js` files, which greatly improves the compilation efficiency.

- **Optimize local development port settings**; The default port of QuickApp is 12306. You can customize the port, but the user experience is not user-friendly. Optimize the usage of the local development address port by referring to the `creat-react-app` setting. If the specified port (default port: '8080') is occupied, the system searches for a new available port (for example, 8081/8082/...) in ascending order.

- ** QR code for opening the debugging home page**; Run the `yarn start` command to start the HTTP debugging server and display the address on the command line terminal. Use the quick app debugger on your mobile phone to scan the code to download and run the rpk package. When the terminal accumulates more information streams, it is inconvenient to scan the code. Therefore, a QR code is added to open the debugging home page in the browser. To disable this function, set `autoOpenBrowser` to `false` in the _command/server.js_ file.

## 5. Built-in commands

|Command|Description|Remarks|
| --- | --- | --- |
| `yarn start` | Start services (server) and monitoring (watch) | Enchantment [Multi-step optimization] (https://nice.lovejade.cn/zh/article/quickapp-boilerplate-template.html#%E6%94%B9%E8%BF%9B%E4%BC%98%E5%8A%BF), one-click development |
| `yarn server`|Enable the service (server)|If it is not too troublesome, use it. It is not recommended.|
| `yarn watch` | Enable monitoring (watch) | Use this function if it is not too troublesome. |
| `yarn build`|Compiling and packaging to generate the `rpk` package|Transfer to the built-in `hap build` command|
| `yarn release`|Generate the `rpk` package and add the signature|Transfer the built-in `hap release` command|
| `yarn start`|Enable the service and enable the listening at the same time.|Recommended?|
